# Diabetes-Prediction
Data Science project on Diabetes Prediction

# Introduction:
Diabetes is one such chronic ailment that grips millions of people all over the world and leads to serious health complications if the condition is not diagnosed and managed at an early stage in life. Machine learning, in this context, can predict the on-set of diabetes with the help of data-driven technologies, and timely interventions can be facilitated. The objective of this project is to develop a Diabetes Prediction System using Django by creating a logistic regression model and making it functional through a user-friendly web application. The system can take in measurements of various health metrics and return immediate predictions, thus enabling early diagnosis and prophylaxis.

Logistic regression is then used to identify a pattern between input variables, such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and other health indicators, assessing the probability of diabetes. A web-based application designed to reach a large part of users will provide a smooth and user-friendly interface where one can easily feed in their data and get results.

The project aims at achieving full integration of machine learning with web development, showing how these technologies can be harmonized to be impactful in healthcare. Besides, the system is developed in such a way as to provide scalability for possible future upgrades, such as adding more predictive models or health metrics.

This is a diabetes prediction system to be used in helping people live healthy lives and as proof of concept on how predictive analytics can do much more in healthcare. It is able to help in early diagnosis, allowing health providers and patients to become proactive in fighting diabetes and its associated complications by offering real-time, data-driven insights.
